                        I have a question.  Is ignorance bliss?  Most people would argue it isn’t and anyone who believes so is dumb.

                        Well I have something I want you to consider first.  Have you ever heard the thought experiment Schrödinger’s Cat?  If not, it goes like this:
                        <blockquote>
                            A cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity (i.e., a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality collapses into one possibility or the other.
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If that seems a little hard to follow, I like to think of it this way:
                        <blockquote>
                            A cat is put in a box with some poisoned food.  If the cat eats the food, it will die, but if it doesn’t, it will live.  We assume there is no way to tell if the cat will eat the food or not and consequently, we do not know whether the cat is alive or not.  Because of this, there are two currently correct realities, one for each state of the cat.  By removing the box and observing, you have now collapsed one reality and cemented the other.
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, this experiment has an interesting afterthought.  Whoever removes the box has verified one reality and collapsed the other.  What if the cat ate the food and died?  Could we technically argue that the cat’s death wasn’t true until the box was removed and the other reality was collapsed?  If so, we could blame the cat’s death on the poor individual who removed the box.  After all, he was alive in our heads until that jerk opened the box.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This line of thinking can be applied to almost everything.  Think about it, what if you are worried your significant other is being unfaithful?  You have two options, either do some digger and confront them (open the box), or ignore the thought that they could be and choose to believe they aren’t.  By confronting them you are collapsing one reality.  If your SO is being faithful, great!  You won the relationship lottery.  Your only taxes are now dealing with your partner’s anger at why you would ever think they could do that to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BUT… What if they have been unfaithful?  You have now confirmed your fear with no one to blame but yourself.  Sure, they did you wrong and I’m not saying what they did was acceptable, but are you happier knowing or would you have rather just been ignorant and lived a happy life none the wiser?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This leads me back to my original question.  Is ignorance bliss?  You tell me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These are the kinds of things I think about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My thoughts are scary…
