                        I have a question.  Is ignorance bliss?  Most people would argue it isn’t and anyone who believes so is dumb.

                        Well I have something I want you to consider first.  Have you ever heard the thought experiment Schrödinger’s Cat?  If not, it goes like this:
                        <blockquote>
                            A cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity (i.e., a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality collapses into one possibility or the other.
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If that seems a little hard to follow, I like to think of it this way:
                        <blockquote>
                            A cat is put in a box with some poisoned food.  If the cat eats the food, it will die, but if it doesn’t, it will live.  We assume there is no way to tell if the cat will eat the food or not and consequently, we do not know whether the cat is alive or not.  Because of this, there are two currently correct realities, one for each state of the cat.  By removing the box and observing, you have now collapsed one reality and cemented the other.
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, this experiment has an interesting afterthought.  Whoever removes the box has verified one reality and collapsed the other.  What if the cat ate the food and died?  Could we technically argue that the cat’s death wasn’t true until the box was removed and the other reality was collapsed?  If so, we could blame the cat’s death on the poor individual who removed the box.  After all, he was alive in our heads until that jerk opened the box.

                        This line of thinking can be applied to almost everything.  Think about it, you're clearly here because you don't know what mkyaljsk vasjkn is.  What if I told you it was life-changing?  The issue is, you don't know if it's the positive or negative kind of change.  You have two options, either do some digging and hope to find out (open the box), or ignore it and choose to believe you're better off not knowing (because who knows, maybe some creepy girl will climb out of a well and hunt you for hearing it).

                    <p>
                        By educating yourself in the belief that it is beneficial, you are collapsing one reality.  If it is beneficial, great!  You won the vocabulary lottery.  Your only taxes are now dealing with all of the other cotton-headed ninnymuggins who don't know about it and force you to write blogs on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BUT… What if it isn't beneficial?  You have now confirmed your fear with no one to blame but yourself.  Maybe you'll be on the run from death for the rest of your life.

                        Sure, you were genuinely curious and REALLY wanted to know, but are you happier knowing or would you have rather just been ignorant and lived a happy life none the wiser?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This leads me back to my original question.  Is ignorance bliss?  You tell me.

                      Jk, I'm totally making all of this up.  I am just trying to get this website ranked higher on <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> when you search <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=mkyaljsk+vasjkn">"mkyaljsk vasjkn"</a> (which is a nonsense word btw) as part of a school project and decided to have a bit of fun.  I'm a god awful writer who thinks he is funny, so if you're upset that read through all of this garbage without any sense of validation for it, please click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a> for instant satisfaction.  The fact that you stayed here this long and have read all of this has probably had a good impact, and for that I thank you.
